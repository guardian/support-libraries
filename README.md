##Releasing
###Releasing to local repo

You can publish all three libraries locally by running:

`sbt publishLocal`

If you really need to publish one library only (for example support-config) then run:

`sbt "project supportConfig" publishLocal`


###Releasing to maven

We use sbt to release to Maven. Please check notes here to ensure you are set up to release to Maven:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M_MiE8qntdDn97QIRnIUci5wdVQ8_defCqpeAwoKY8g/edit#heading=h.r815791vmxv5

Currently each library is versioned separately and must be released separately, this can be done using the command:

`sbt "project [the project]" release`
